# .cursor-rules.md â€” FileMaker MCP Server

## Code Style
- Use TypeScript strict mode, ESM imports, and descriptive variable/function names.
- Prefer early returns and clear error handling.
- Use const for functions and avoid mutation.
- Keep code DRY and modular.

## Commit Messages
- Use Conventional Commits: feat:, fix:, chore:, docs:, test:, refactor:, perf:, ci:
- Example: `feat: add Docker support`

## Pull Requests
- All PRs must pass CI (test, lint, build).
- Add/modify tests for new features or bugfixes.
- Update docs and .claude.md for user-facing changes.

## Testing
- All code must be covered by unit or integration tests.
- Use Jest and Nock for mocking FileMaker API.
- Manual E2E tests with Claude/AI before major releases.

## Security
- Never commit secrets or credentials.
- Validate all user input and handle errors gracefully.
- Use HTTPS for all FileMaker API calls.

## Extensibility
- New FileMaker features/tools should be added as new methods and tool schemas.
- Keep MCP tool schemas up to date.

## Docker & CI/CD
- Dockerfile must support production and local dev.
- .dockerignore should keep images lean but include dist/.
- All builds and tests must pass in CI (GitHub Actions).
- Main branch auto-publishes to npm (if secrets configured).
